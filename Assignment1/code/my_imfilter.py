% This function that you will implement is intended to behave like the built-in function 
% imfilter() in Matlab or equivalently the same function implemented as part of scipy.misc module
% in Python. You will implement imfilter from first principles, i.e., without using 
% any library functions. 

% See 'help imfilter' or 'help conv2'. While terms like "filtering" and
% "convolution" might be used interchangeably, we will essentially perform 2D correlation 
% between the filter and image. Referring to 'proj1_test_filtering.py' would help you with
% your implementation. 
  
% Your function should work for color images. Simply filter each color
% channel independently.

% Your function should work for filters of any width and height
% combination, as long as the width and height are odd (e.g. 1, 7, 9). This
% restriction makes it unambigious which pixel in the filter is the center
% pixel.

% Boundary handling can be tricky. The filter can't be centered on pixels
% at the image boundary without parts of the filter being out of bounds. If
% you look at 'help conv2' and 'help imfilter' in Matlab, you see that they have
% several options to deal with boundaries. You should simply recreate the
% default behavior of imfilter -- pad the input image with zeros, and
% return a filtered image which matches the input resolution. A better
% approach would be to mirror the image content over the boundaries for padding.

% % Uncomment if you want to simply call library imfilter so you can see the desired
% % behavior. When you write your actual solution, **you can't use imfilter,
% % correlate, convolve commands, but implement the same using matrix manipulations**. 
% % Simply loop over all the pixels and do the actual
% % computation. It might be slow.
